  description: A visually rich document refers to a structured or semi-structured document where visual features play an important role in semantics. We propose a fast, multi-scale classifier for such documents. For fast inference, we define an attention-like operator that extracts visual features from a hierarchical abstraction defined using the layout hierarchy of each document. Discriminative features are extracted using a depth-separable convolutional network leveraging this hierarchical construct. We obtained state-of-the-art results on four publicly available datasets.<br/> Here Here
