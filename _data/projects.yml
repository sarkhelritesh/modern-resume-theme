  description: 
  A visually rich document is a structured or semi-structured document where visual features play an important role in semantics. We propose a fast, multi-scale classifier for such documents in this work. For fast inference, we define an attention-like operator that extracts visual features from a hierarchical layout abstraction defined for each document. Discriminative features are extracted using a depth-separable convolutional network. State-of-the-art results are obtained for four publicly available benchmark datasets.
