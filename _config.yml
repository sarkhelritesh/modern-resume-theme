  Hello! I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="https://cse.osu.edu"><mark>The Ohio State University</mark></a>. I work with <a href="http://arnab.org"><mark>Prof. Arnab Nandi</mark></a> in the Interactive Data Systems Laboratory.
  
  My primary research focus is building intelligent systems for interactive data exploration in <a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35"><u><font color="#000000">Software 2.0</font></u></a>.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
