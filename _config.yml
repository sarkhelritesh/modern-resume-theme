more_background: Before graduate school, I was a part of the <a href="http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=59"><u>CMATER Research Laboratory</u></a> at Jadavpur University, India, where I developed cost-effective optical character recognition systems for Indian languages. Read about some of our findings <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320316300437"><u>here</u></a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320317302200"><u>here</u></a>. Many moons ago, I used to be a part of a research and development group in Samsung Research Institute, India with a focus on accesibility of handheld devices. Read about some of the products I have worked on <a href="http://design.samsung.com/global/contents/accessibility_design/"><u>here</u></a>.<br/><br/> I have served as a reviewer for journals including IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, Soft Computing, and IEEE Access.
